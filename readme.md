# WPF Counter Thingy

Attempting to create an application where one can view a photo and then zoom in and add points on it like a map. The points are counted and kept track of by color and catagory. 

# Ideas
* Save counts and other data in photo's .exif data - Maybe automatically in the background
* Option to read/disply prior photos via thier .exif data
* Photo Picker/Saver
* Text Comment Area
* Display .exif data regarding date/location/camera type/etc 
* Smaller thumbnail map with current view highlighted
